"""Skill functionality — the agent's skill-loading surface, all in one package.

Three layers live here:

* :class:`SkillCatalog` (``catalog.py``) — the **agent-agnostic, open-standard**
  reader. Any agent process points it at *its own* per-process ``skills_root``;
  a bundle is identified by its ``SKILL.md`` YAML frontmatter (``name`` +
  ``description``), surfaced cheaply at session start, with bodies pulled on
  demand (progressive disclosure).
* the incumbent **manifest loader** (``loader.py``: ``load_skills`` /
  ``list_skill_manifests`` / ``register_activated_skills``) — bound to
  ``skills/<name>/manifest.json`` + recon-phase trigger predicates; registers a
  bundle's ``tool.py`` skill-scoped tools. Re-exported from ``ludo.tools`` for
  back-compat.
* the **consult tool** (``consult_skill.py``) — reads a named skill's ``SKILL.md``
  body at runtime (``read_file`` is sandboxed and can't reach ``skills/``).

Canonical doc: ``docs/skills.md`` (tools + calling verbs: ``docs/tools.md``).
