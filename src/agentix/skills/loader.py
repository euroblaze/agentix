"""Skills loader — scan ``skills/<name>/manifest.json`` at startup.

Each skill bundle is a directory following the v2 schema documented
in ``skills/SCHEMA.md``. Minimum required:

* ``manifest.json`` — ``{"name", "version", "description", "tools": [...],
  "trigger": {...}}``. The legacy ``customer`` field is accepted but
  ignored with a deprecation warning — skills under v2 are general,
  not per-customer.
* ``tool.py`` — a python module exporting a ``register(registry)``
  function. The loader imports the module and hands it the shared
  registry so the bundle can register its tool(s).
* ``SKILL.md`` (recommended) — the doctrine the agent loads when the
  skill triggers. Loader doesn't read it; the recon phase does.

No hot-reload in v0.1 (arch.md §10.2). A skill's tools conflict
with builtins only if the skill deliberately shadows — the registry
raises ``ToolConflict`` in that case.

Trigger-predicate evaluation is the **recon phase's** responsibility,
not the loader's. The loader's job is to validate the manifest and
register the skill's tools so they're available when the recon phase
decides to load the skill. This separation keeps the loader simple
and the trigger logic close to where the recon report is built.
