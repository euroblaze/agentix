"""Global driver capacity limiter (isolation.md I5).

Session-owned state is per-task, but *shared external capacity* — the concurrent
model calls the whole process may have in flight — is intentionally governed by one
process-global limiter, not per-session. Without it, ``gather``-over-Sessions (or
multi-agent fan-out) would multiply concurrent upstream calls by the number of
live sessions and trip provider rate limits / exhaust sockets.

The limiter is a single semaphore acquired around every driver I/O call
(chat ``complete``, embedding ``embed``, stt ``transcribe``). It is keyed by
running event loop so it is safe to reuse across test loops (each loop gets its
own instance) while remaining a single shared gate within the one loop a
production worker runs — the "global" scope that matters. Per-kind / per-driver
limits are DIRECTION (``docs/drivers.md``).
