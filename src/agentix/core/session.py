"""Session — the checkpoint-first, resumable unit of an agent run.

The ``Session`` object carries conversation history, progress, and token /
cost totals. It is **app-agnostic**: generic operational fields plus an
``app_meta`` dict the app fills with its own scope (the migration app stores
source/target version + target models there). Persistence is split across the
storage layer:

* Operational metadata (tenant, status, totals, named checkpoint, app_meta)
  lives in SQLite.
* The full state blob (messages, tool results, cursors) is JSON-serialised
  to MinIO under ``checkpoints/{session_id}/{checkpoint}.json``.

``save`` writes both — SQLite row first, then MinIO blob. ``resume_from``
reads both and rebuilds the in-memory ``Session``.
