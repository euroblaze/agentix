"""Retry middleware — bounded exponential backoff over provider failures.

Wraps the LLM call with a jittered retry loop. Retries *only* on provider
errors the adapter already classified as retryable
(``DriverRateLimited`` / ``DriverUnavailable``); ``DriverInvalidRequest``
bails out immediately. Tool failures are *not* retried here — tools own
their own retry loops, typically over the midlayer's
:class:`agentix.tools.resilience.TransientRetry` strike ledger.
