# Context Management

**Status:** planning · **Scope:** Agentix kernel `[K]` (app-agnostic) · **Opened:** 2026-07-06

Living design + worklog for how the kernel decides *what occupies the model window at
every step*. Update as decisions land. Not a numbered spec — when a slice is ready to
build, cut a `specs/` entry and link it back here.

---

## What this is (and isn't)

Context-management is the **policy layer**: assemble -> budget -> compress -> evict, once
per model step. It is NOT storage. Storage = memory tiers / knowledge substrate. This layer
*decides what enters the window* from those stores + tools + skills + history.

Today that logic is scattered (memory retrieval, skill disclosure, history handling, tool
schemas each assemble themselves). Consolidating it into one owner is the CRIE win.

## Assets to build on (already in the cluster)

- **Progressive disclosure** — Skills `S3->S1->S0` cascade + `SkillCatalog`. This IS
  context-management; generalise the same summary-in / body-on-demand pattern to tools,
  memory, knowledge. (see `docs/tools.md`, `docs/skills.md`)
- **Checkpoints** — `core/checkpoints.py`; context reconstruction on resume rides this spine.
- **Eval** — Verdict + Grader A (responses) / B (outcomes). Every context policy must be
  measurable here. (see `docs/proposals/eval-validation.md`)
- **Memory tiers** — `consult_memory`, applied_memory_rules (retrieval source, not the policy).
- **Window reports / metrics** — introspection surface for "what was in-window and why".

## Design dimensions (the checklist)

1. **Budget & accounting** — one explicit token budget per step, one owner. Shared pool:
   guardrails, goal, working set, retrieved memory, tool outputs, history all compete.
   *Instrument before optimising* — measure what's actually in-window first.
2. **Deterministic assembly + priority tiers** — fixed pipeline, fixed evict-order. Also a
   cost lever: a stable prefix maximises prompt-cache hits.
3. **Retrieval gating** — decide *when* / *how much* to pull from memory, ranked by
   relevance. Over-retrieval poisons the window. Don't dump.
4. **Compression & eviction** — rolling summary, tool-output truncation/dedup,
   checkpoint-anchored reconstruction. Define lossy-safe vs. must-be-verbatim.
5. **Untrusted context = security** — retrieved memory + tool outputs are injection vectors.
   Safety instructions un-evictable and structurally separated from untrusted content.
6. **Multi-agent isolation (A2A)** — per-agent windows; sub-agents return distilled
   conclusions, not raw context. Orchestrator context != worker context. Two planes, don't
   conflate: the *crossing* law (only distilled context crosses a Session boundary) is
   canonical as [`isolation.md`](isolation.md) P-ISO-2; the inter-agent NATS-Account isolation
   is `proposals/agentic-cluster-a2a.md`.
7. **Observability** — per-step window report: what entered, why, token cost. Ties to metrics + omg.

## Architecture direction (draft)

- A first-class kernel component — `ContextManager` / context-assembler, tagged `[K]`.
- Single seam between the stores (memory/tools/skills/knowledge) and the executor: hands
  back a **budgeted, ordered, safety-partitioned** window.
- App (LUDO) supplies only the *sources*; the assembly/budget/evict policy is kernel.
- CRIE: this component replaces the scattered per-source assembly.

**Priority tiers (eviction order), draft — highest survives:**
`guardrails/safety (never evict) > task/goal > active working set > retrieved memory > history`

## Alignment with session-management

Canonical contract + genericity check: [`session.md`](session.md) § Session ↔ Context
alignment (single source of truth — not restated here). In short: **the Session is the durable
store of a run's context; the ContextManager is the per-step policy over it — one object, two
sides.** They are *not* aligned today (the session snapshot persists raw `messages`;
`working_memory` is an ad-hoc second compressor). Policy-side consequences for this doc:

- The ContextManager writes the **managed** window that the Session snapshots (not raw
  history) — so **S2 (compression) and the session's resume are the same co-designed work.**
- The ContextManager owns the per-step **window/token** budget and reports consumption into the
  Session's **cost** ledger — two budgets, one flow.
- Both are `[K]`; the app feeds only *sources*. Resume must be kernel-generic (a resume-key
  extension point) or a non-migration app inherits no recovery — see session.md clause 4.
- The per-step budget is owned here but *scoped per session-task* and *ceilinged per customer* by
  [`isolation.md`](isolation.md) I4/I5, so parallel sessions don't spend N× or overload Odoo/LLM.

## Open decisions

- [ ] Component boundary: standalone `ContextManager` vs. folded into Cortex spine?
- [ ] Who owns the token budget, and how it's threaded to sub-agents (sub-agent = child Session; threading rule → [`isolation.md`](isolation.md)).
- [ ] Cache-prefix contract — what must stay byte-stable for prompt-cache hits.
- [ ] Summary cadence + what is lossy-safe to compress.
- [ ] How a context policy plugs into eval (A/B) as a measurable experiment.
- [ ] `[K]`/`[A]` split of context *sources*.
- [ ] Shared managed-context-state object shape (what the Session snapshots) — co-owned with session.md.
- [ ] New kernel component # in the inventory (agentix#1) — ContextManager = #20; the runtime/isolation model (**SessionRuntime**) = #21 (see [`isolation.md`](isolation.md)).

## Roadmap / slices

Sequence is instrument-first; each slice ships behind eval.

- **S0 — Instrument + budget core.** ContextManager assembles deterministically, enforces one
  budget, reports the window per step. Foundation. *Slice A landed: `core/context_manager.py`
  (`ContextManager` + `AssembledContext` + `Tier` + `WindowEntry`) — assemble → compress →
  window report, reusing `context.py`'s budget + compression. Slice B landed: the dispatcher's
  `_build_request` now assembles through `ContextManager` (`compress=False`), replacing the
  inline working-memory injection — one assembly path. Compression stays with TokenBudget
  middleware; unifying the budget step is the next slice.*
- **S1 — Generalise progressive disclosure.** Extend `S3->S1->S0` to tools/memory/knowledge.
  Highest leverage, lowest risk, reuses a proven mechanism.
- **S2 — Compression + checkpoint resume.** Long-running sessions. *Co-designed with
  session.md S0 (wire resume) — same work from two sides.*
- **S3 — Eval harness for context policies.** Make every change measurable.

## Worklog

- **2026-07-06** — doc opened. Framing, dimensions, assets, architecture direction captured.
  First slice not yet chosen (S0 recommended). No code yet.
- **2026-07-06** — aligned with session-management (storage-vs-policy framing, budget
  reconciliation, S2=session-S0 co-design, kernel-generic resume). Canonical contract in session.md.
- **2026-07-06** — reconciled with the runtime plane: [`isolation.md`](isolation.md) added (axiom
  + I1–I7). Split dim-6 into its two planes (P-ISO-2 crossing vs a2a Account isolation); budget
  scoping/ceiling links to I4/I5; reserved inventory #21 SessionRuntime.
- **2026-07-06** — S0 slice A: `core/context_manager.py` built (additive). `ContextManager`
  owns assemble → compress → window report with priority `Tier`s (SYSTEM > WORKING_MEMORY > SUMMARY >
  HISTORY), mirroring the dispatcher's current `_build_request` assembly so the rewire (slice B)
  is a clean swap. Reuses `ContextBudget` + `summarise_oldest_tool_results` (no duplication).
  Unit tests added. Consolidates the working-memory-injection + budget scatter (agentix#20).
